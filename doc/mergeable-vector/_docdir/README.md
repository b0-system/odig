mergeable-vector — Mergeable vector based on operational transformation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.1.0

mergeable-vector is vector library with support for [3-way
merges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)#Three-way_merge)
based on [operational
transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation). The
library also provides diffing and patching arbitrary vectors. The diff is
computed by [Wagner-Fischer
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm).

mergeable-vector is distributed under the ISC license.

## Installation

mergeable-vector can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install mergeable-vector

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`ocamldoc` from the interfaces. It can be consulted [online][doc]
and there is a generated version in the `doc` directory of the
distribution.

## Sample programs

If you installed mergeable-vector with `opam` sample programs are located in
the directory `opam config var mergeable-vector:doc`.

In the distribution sample programs and tests are located in the
[`test`](test) directory of the distribution. They can be built and run
with:

    topkg build --tests true && topkg test
