After &quot;release&quot; is called, stdin is connected to /dev/null, and stdout and stderr are connected as specified by <code>redirect_stdout</code> and <code>redirect_stderr</code>. The default is the usual behavior whereby both of these descriptors are connected to /dev/null. <code>daemonize_wait</code>, however, will not redirect stdout/stderr to /dev/null if they are already redirected to a regular file by default, i.e., default redirection is <code>`Dev_null_skip_regular_files</code>. This is to preserve behavior from earlier versions.)</p><p>Note that calling <code>release</code> will adjust SIGPIPE handling, so you should not rely on the delivery of this signal during this time.</p><p><code>daemonize_wait</code> allows you to daemonize and then start asynchronously, but still have stdout/stderr go to the controlling terminal during startup. By default, when you <code>daemonize</code>, toplevel exceptions during startup would get sent to /dev/null. With <code>daemonize_wait</code>, toplevel exceptions can go to the terminal until you call <code>release</code>.</p><p>Forking (especially to daemonize) when running multiple threads is tricky and generally a mistake. <code>daemonize</code> and <code>daemonize_wait</code> check that the current number of threads is not greater than expected. <code>daemonize_wait</code> and <code>daemonize</code> also check that threads have not been created, which is more conservative than the actual requirement that multiple threads are not running. Using <code>~allow_threads_to_have_been_created:true</code> bypasses that check. This is useful if Async was previously running, and therefore threads have been created, but has since been shut down. On non-Linux platforms, using <code>~allow_threads_to_have_been_created:true</code> eliminates the protection <code>daemonize</code> and <code>daemonize_wait</code> have regarding threads.</p><p>Raises <code>Failure</code> if forking was unsuccessful.</p></dd></dl></div></body></html>
