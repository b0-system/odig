{b WARNING.} This package is unstable and work in progress, do not depend
on it.

B0 describes software construction and deployments using modular and
customizable definitions written in OCaml.

B0 is built on top of the B00 build library which provides arbitrary
build abstraction with reliable, efficient incremental rebuilds.

{1:b00_libs B00}

B00 is the build model used by B0. It can be used for its own good to
devise domain specific build system â€“ see for example the [brzo] or
[odig] tools.

The {{!b00_std}[b0.b00.std]} and {{!b00_kit}[b0.b00.kit]} libraries also
provide sharp tools for quick "scripts" and command line tools even if you
are not using {{!b00}[b0.b00]}.

{2:b00_std Library [b0.b00.std]}

The [b0.b00.std] library has a few things that should be in the stdlib
and a few others that should not be but are useful for B0 and B00
based programs.

{!modules: B00_std}

{2:b00 Library [b0.b00]}

The build library.

{!modules: B000 B000_conv B00}

{2:b00_kit Library [b0.b00.kit]}

Toolkit for working with B00 and B0. A few things do not depend on the
[b0.b00] library but are useful to have under your hand.
