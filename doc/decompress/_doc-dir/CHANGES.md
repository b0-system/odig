### v1.3.0 2020-03-03 Paris (France)

- Add a little executable to benchmark inflation into the distribution (@dinosaure, #93)
- Add instructions for running benchmark (@gs0510, #94)
- Clarify the description (@XVilka, #96)
- Improve the benchmark and outputs (@dinosaure, @gs0510, #95)
- Avoid allocation of distance table (@Engil, @dinosaure, #97)
- Swapping from arithmetic to logical bitshifts on `d.hold` (@clecat, #99)
- Make the use of all `Higher.compress` arguments (@vect0r-vicall, #103)
- Apply ocamlformat.0.16.0 (@dinosaure, #105, #107)
- Improve Lz77 algorithms (@dinosaure, #108)
  **breaking changes** the deflation expects a new window: `De.Lz77.make_window`
  instead of `De.make_window` (which is twice larger to improve the compression
  algorithm)

  Depending on the level and your corpus, we did not observe performance
  regression on deflation (and #97 improves a lot performances). An higher level
  is slower (but the compression ratio is better). We advise, by default, to use
  the level 6.

  Note that the user is able to make its own compression algorithm according to
  his corpus. An example of such implementation is available on the new
  `decompress.lz` libraries which fills a queue and compress the input.

  **breaking changes** decompress expects a level between 0 and 9 (inclusive)
  (instead of 0 and 3).
- Add tests about level compression (@dinosaure, #109)
- Add level on GZip layer (@dinosaure, #110)
- Provide a `ctypes` reverse binding (@dinosaure, #98)
- Provide a binary `decompress.pipe` which can compress/uncompress with
  deflate, zlib or gzip format.

### v1.0.0 2019-08-30 Paris (France)

** breaking changes **

`decompress.1.0.0` is 3 times faster about decompression than before. A huge
[amount of work was done](https://tarides.com/blog/2019-08-26-decompress-the-new-decompress-api.html) to improve performance and coverage.

The main reason to update the API is to fix a bad design decision regarding split
compression and encoding. User is able to implement a new compression algorithm
and use it.

Release comes with regressions:
- `decompress` only supports `Bigarray` now, not `Bytes`
- GZIP layer does not exist anymore
- state of RFC1951 encoder/decoder is not referentially transparent anymore

Of course, v1.0.0 comes with fixes and improvements:
- `decompress` is able to compress/uncompress [Calgary corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary_corpus)
- tests are improved and they include all coverage tests from `zlib`
- compression algorithm has a fuzzer
- encoder has a fuzzer
- performance about decoder is 3 times better than `decompress.v0.9.0` and 3
  times slower than `zlib`

`decompress` is split into 2 main modules:
- `dd` which implements RFC1951
- `zz` which implements ZLIB

API of them are pretty-close to what `decompress.v0.9.0` does with some
advantages on `dd`:
- User can use their own compression algorithm instead of `Dd.L`
- encoder exposes more granular control over what it emits (which block, when, where)
- Huffman tree generation is out of `dd`

As a response to #25, `dd` provides a _higher_ level API resembling `camlzip`.

### v0.9.0 2019-07-10 Paris (France)

* Add support of 4.07 and 4.08 in Travis (@XVilka, @dinosaure, #70, #71)
* Use `mmap` (@XVilka, @dinosaure, @hannesm, #68, #69, #71)
* Update documentation (@yurug, @dinosaure, #65, #66)
* Micro-optimization about specialization (@dinosaure, #64)
* Re-organize internals of `decompress` (@dinosaure, #63) 
* GZIP support (@clecat, review by @dinosaure, @cfcs, @hannesm, #60)
 - fix #58 (@dinosaure)

### v0.8.1 2018-10-16 Paris (France)

* _Dunify_ project (@dinosaure)
* *breaking-change* Unbox `Bytes.t` and `Bigstring.t` as I/O buffer (@dinosaure)
* Add foreign tests vectors (@cfcs, @dinosaure)
* Catch invalid distance (@XVilka, @dinosaure)
* Better check on dictionaries (@XVilka, @dinosaure)
* *breaking-change* Add [wbits] argument to check Window size on RFC1951 (@XVilka, @dinosaure)

### v0.8 2018-07-09 Paris (France)

* Implementation of RFC1951 (task from @cfcs)
* *breaking change* New interface of decompress

  We wrap API in `Zlib_{inflate/deflate}` and add `RFC1951_{inflate/deflate}`.
  
* Move to `jbuilder`/`dune` (task from @samoht)
* Better check on `zlib` header
* Fixed infinite loop (task fron @cfcs)

  See 2e3af68, `decompress` has an infinite loop when the inflated dictionary
  does not provide any bindings (and length of opcode is <= 0). In this case,
  `decompress` expects an empty input and provide an empty output in any case.
  
* Use re.1.7.2 on tests
* Use camlzip.1.07 on tests

### v0.7 2017-10-18 Paris (France)

* Fixed Inflate.write function
* Fixed internal state to stick in a internal final state
* Fixed compilation with js_of_ocaml (use trampoline function to avoid
  stack-overflow)
* Fixed clash of name about state variable in the Inflate module
* Add afl program
* Export Adler-32 modules
* Add -i and -o option in the dpipe binary to inform the size of the
  internal chunk
* Change the value of -mode in the dpipe binary

### v0.6 2017-05-11 Cao LÃ£nh (Vietnam)

- Fixed bug #29
- Produce far pattern (Lz77 compression)
- Optimize memory consumption of the Inflate module
- Move repository from oklm-wsh to mirage

### v0.5 2017-02-17 Essaouira (Maroc)

- Stabilize the interface (@dbuenzli's interface)
