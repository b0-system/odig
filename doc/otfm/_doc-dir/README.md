## Sample programs 

Sample programs are located in the `test` directory of the
distribution. They can be built with:

    topkg build --tests true 

- `test.byte` tests the library, nothing should fail.
- `otftrip.native`, among other things, reads an OpenType file and
  prints a human readable representation on `stdout`. Invoke with
  `-help` for more information.
