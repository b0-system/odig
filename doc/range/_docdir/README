Range Library

This small library has two goals :
   * enable to fold a sequence of integers like a list
   * split a range, making distributed computing easy

Example of usage

    (* print numbers between 100 and 200 *)
     Range.(from 100 200 |> iter (Printf.printf "%d\n"));;

     (* print sum of all values between 1 and 50 *)
     Range.(from 1 50 |> fold (+) 0 |> print_int);;
     
     (* print sum of all values between 1 and 50, adding 4 to all elements and excluding 53 *)
     Range.(from 1 50 |> map ((+) 4) |> filter ((!=) 53) |> fold (+) 0 |> print_int);;
