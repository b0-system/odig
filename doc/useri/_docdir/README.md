Useri — Declarative user input for OCaml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release v0.0.0-82-g567f882

Useri gathers user input as [React][react] signals and events. 

Useri can be used with different backends. The library comes
with a backend that depends on [Tsdl][tsdl] and a JavaScript backend 
that depends on [js_of_ocaml][jsoo].

Useri and its backends depend on [React][react] and [Gg][gg]. They are
distributed under the ISC license.
