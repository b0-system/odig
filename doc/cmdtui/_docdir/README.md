cmdtui — interactive command completion and execution for building REPLs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cmdtui is a module for declaring commands with completions and actions.
It can return a dynamically generated list of completions based on partial user
input.
The base module doesn't depend on a particular terminal control library,
and support for `lambda-term` based REPLs is provided in the `cmdtui.lambda-term` subpackage.

cmdtui is distributed under the ISC license.
